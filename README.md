# SQS Evenbridge POC

This project is an example of how to use SQS and Evenbridge with AWS CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute this app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `npx cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `npx cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `npx cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
- `npx cdk destroy` destroy the stack (all resources will be deleted and data will be lost, but we make sure we don't incur additional charges)
